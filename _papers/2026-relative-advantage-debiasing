Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times
are influenced by confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user behaviors, potentially
distorting preference signals and resulting in biased recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage
debiasing framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived reference distributions conditioned
on user and item groups. This approach yields a quantilebased preference signal and introduces a two-stage architecture that 
explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to 
efficiently parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage of historical data. 
Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing baseline methods.
