Cellular automata are dynamic systems of "cell"-like objects that evolve over time to generate patterns. They have been studied extensively for their application to physics, biology, ecology, sociology, and more, in addition to posing interesting theoretical questions. Ideal for lovers of programming, mathematics, and art, this class will open with a brief lecture on history and application, as well as the rules for some basic CA. Students will then have the opportunity to implement elementary CA and Conway's Game of Life in Python.
